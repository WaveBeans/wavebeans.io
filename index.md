WaveBeans
=========

WaveBeans is a set of tools to process audio signals using Kotlin/Java/Scala/etc. You can either use it via command line or develop your own program which can be run as a part of you application:

* generate signals and new instruments;
* change existing signals, wave-files or audio streams;
* mix different audio streams together;
* research and explore audio signals;
* make preparation for machine learning algorithms;
* and many more.

Everything using one tool in single- or multi-threaded environment, or even distributing computation across multiple nodes (WIP).

Project status
--------

The project is in active development and considered to be a pre-alpha version. It's not intended yet to be used in critical production systems, though it can be used for a variety of research problems and home labs.
